# 1. Two Sum

### Qn: 

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Logic:
Given: An array nums, A target number
To find: two indices (i, j) such that:

```c
nums[i] + nums[j] == target   # i ≠ j
```
