# 1. Two Sum

### ⚙️ Qn: 

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### 🧮 Logic:
Given: An array `nums`, A `target` number

```c
nums[] = array of integers
target = integer
```

To find: two indices (i, j) such that:

```c
nums[i] + nums[j] == target   # i != j
```
