# 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are grouped by Platform/Data Structure/Level/Topic, and each topic contains solutions for multiple questions and Logical Flow of solving, Learnings, Mistakes, etc. Each problem is numbered as per the Coding Platform list for easy reference.

Please note: the prac.cpp file includes some random questions of all topics which i used to practice and prepare for my viva examinations.

I have referred to [GFG DSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/) for questions.

# 🏗️ LeetCode Problem-Solving Strategy

Phase 1: Foundation 
- Don't jump to hard problems. Start with:
1. Array operations (sum, max/min, reverse)
2. String manipulation
3. Basic math problems
4. Simple loops and conditions

- Learn These 10 Patterns (in order):
1. Two Pointers
2. Sliding Window
3. Hash Map / Set
4. Binary Search
5. Stack / Queue
6. Linked List basics
7. Tree traversal (BFS/DFS)
8. Simple DP (Fibonacci style)
9. Recursion basics
10. Sorting algorithms

Phase 2: The Problem-Solving Process

- Understand Deeply (10-15 minutes)
-
