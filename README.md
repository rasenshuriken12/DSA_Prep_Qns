# DSA_Prep_Qns

This repository contains my solutions to **basic to medium-level Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems**. The questions are sourced from the GeeksforGeeks DSA practice list and are categorized by data structures for easy navigation.
---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are grouped by data structure/topic, and each file contains solutions for multiple questions. Each problem is numbered as per the GeeksforGeeks list for easy reference.
Please note: the prt.c file includes some random questions of all topics which i used to practice and prepare for my viva examinations

### Example Folder Structure:

```html
LeetCode/
|
├── Arrays/ 
├── (Question 1: Find minimum or maximum number in array)
├── (Question 2:find last duplicate number in sorted array)
|
├── Stacks/
├── stacks.c (Question 1: Implement a stack using arrays)
|
├── Queues/
├── queue.c (Question 1: Circular queue implementation)

```
