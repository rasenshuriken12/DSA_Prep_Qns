# DSA_Prep_Qns


# Overview



## 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are grouped by data structure/topic, and each file contains solutions for multiple questions. Each problem is numbered as per the GeeksforGeeks list for easy reference.
Please note: the prt.c file includes some random questions of all topics which i used to practice and prepare for my viva examinations

### Example Folder Structure:
