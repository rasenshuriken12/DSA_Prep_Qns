# DSA_Prep_Qns


# Overview
This repository contains my solutions to **basic to medium-level Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems**. The questions are sourced from the GeeksforGeeks DSA practice list and are categorized by data structures for easy navigation.

## ✍️ Highlights
- **Total Questions Solved:** 10+(and will continue to do more😊) 
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are grouped by Data Structure/Level/Topic, and each topic contains solutions for multiple questions and Flow of solving, Learnings, Mistakes, etc. Each problem is numbered as per the GeeksforGeeks list for easy reference.
Please note: the prac.c file includes some random questions of all topics which i used to practice and prepare for my viva examinations
